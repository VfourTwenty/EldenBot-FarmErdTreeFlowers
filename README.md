Do you enjoy Elden Ring multiplayer but find farming Erdleaf Flowers frustrating?
Especially when you run out of the summon potion after countless attempts to beat the next impossible boss?

Well, none of that anymore!
This new farming bot will collect the flowers for you at the Four Belfries grace while you walk away from your computer and chill.
You can even leave it overnight—if it stumbles due to lag, it will successfully perform a teleport routine and restart.

This video demo shows how easy it is to start the bot:

Here, the bot stumbled on the third attempt to collect the flower and teleported. It happens because the camera position shifts slightly with each run. The bot has been able to perform between 1 and 20 runs without teleportation.

Install the requirements with:
pip install -r requirements.txt
or manually, as this repo is not a full python project

then (IMPORTANT!!) place the helper file like this in your project:

another IMPORTANT thing is to configure the keyboard camera rotation in the game, as it's not enabled by default.
For the bot to work, only rotation to the right is needed, and is expected to be the 'l' key in the bot file.
